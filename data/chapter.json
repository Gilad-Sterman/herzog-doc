Those who are found in harbours are big and rough, and for the greater part have their flower of a black colour, but some have it red and small. Of those that are big some attain the weight of a mina. Those which are upon the shores and in the proximity of promontories are small in size but have their flower red, at least in far the greater part. The <<i#Purpurae<< are caught in spring tide at the time when they make their wax. In the dog days they are not caught for then they do not feed but they hide and squat. Their flower is placed between the micon and the neck. The connection of these two parts is thick; the colour is like that of a white membrane which can be removed; on being squeezed it taints and colours the hand. There is something like a vein crossing it. It is this which is regarded as the flower, the remainder being like alum. The flower of the <<i#Purpurae<< is worst when they make their wax. The small <<i#Purpurae<< are crushed together with their shells, for it would be hard to detach their flower. From the bigger ones, on the other hand, the flower is separated after the shell has been removed. In this way the neck becomes separated from the micon; for the flower being placed between the two, over that which is called the stomach, its (i.e., the flower’s) removal necessarily separates the two. Care is taken to crush the <<i#Purpurae<< while they are alive, for if the <<i#Purpura<< dies before that operation it ejects and vomits its flower. For this reason also, they are kept in nets until a sufficient quantity of them has been collected to allow of their being expeditiously bruised.",

This author is a model of painstaking exactness, at least in his work on ancient purple, and in the correctness of his references to the classics yields, I think, to none of the authors I have come across in my study of the subject. The meaning of the respective terms is indeed the same in Greek and in Latin: Buccinum and Kerux trumpet, i.e., trumpet-like shell. Yet I cannot refrain from giving expression on my part to the suspicion that the Kerux of Aristotle is not identical with the Buccinum of Pliny. I have not been able to discover a single explicit reference in Aristotle to the Kerux being employed in purple dyeing, though it is generally associated with the Porphyra in that author.

L’auteur grec a eu en vue deux espèces bien distinctes; l’une vivant dans les golfes et donnant une pourpre noire, (je crois qu’il faut interpréter noire par rouge très foncé), l’autre vivant dans la mer et donnant une pourpre rouge, c’est-à-dire plus claire. En cela il a raison, car on sait parfaitement aujourd’hui que la pourpre rouge sombre est donnée par la <<i#Purpura<< haemastoma L. et la Murex trunculus L. qui vivent dans la zone littorale, collés contre les rochers; et que la pourpre plus claire est fournie par la Murex brandaris L., qui vit a une plus grande profondeur et plus loin du rivage.

The Greek author had in mind two very distinct species; one living in the gulfs and giving a black purple, (I think we should interpret black by very dark red), the other living in the sea and giving a red purple, that is to say lighter. In this he is right, because we know perfectly well today that the dark red purple is given by the <<i#Purpura<< haemastoma L, and the Murex trunculus L, which live in the littoral zone, stuck against the rocks; and that the lighter purple is supplied by Murex brandaris L., which live at greater depth and further from shore.

It is generally assumed that the dye-secretion yielded by both genera <<i#Purpura<< and Murex is characterised by very great durability. I am not quite sure that the assumption is correct in so far as it is meant to embrace all the species belonging to the genus <<i#Purpura<<: it certainly fails to hold good universally with reference to Murex trunculus.<<26<< May not Pliny be referring to a species of <<i#Purpura<< yielding a red fugitive dye? The fact that the dye secretions of <<i#Purpura<< haemastoma, <<i#Purpura<< lapillus and <<i#Purpura<< patula have each been proved to be very fast to light, to washing and to corrosives of various kinds offers no fatal objection. It is just sufficient to compare the case of murex. Taking, however, into consideration that <<i#Purpura<< haemastoma is known to have been actually used in ancient purple dyeing and, to judge by the high qualities of its dye-stuff must have been, if not the only one, at least one of the principal species so employed and combining this with the fact that the other genus used in purple dyeing besides the buccinum (our <<i#Purpura<<) corresponds to our murex, we are forced to admit as improbable that Pliny would in treating of purple leave out all mention of <<i#Purpura<< haemastoma, singling out some obscure species instead.",

Yet in ransacking the classics I have come across a certain passage which has furnished food for thought on the point. “Thou knowest that the dyers, when they wish to dye wool so as to give it the colour called alourges chose first among wool of different colours that which is white: then they prepare it with very great care so that it may imbibe as much of the dye as possible: after that they dye it. Thus prepared, the dye never passes off, and the fabric, whether washed with or without corrosives preserves its colour in its full strength. But if wool of another coloration is used instead, or even the white wool without proper preparation, thou knowest what the result is? Yes, a fugitive colour and an unpleasant one.”",

Die farbige Flüssigkeit der Aplysien sondert sich von selber, sobald man dem Thiere die Muschel abgenommen hat, und bedarf weiter keiner Vorkehrungen, während jene von dem Murex allerlei Operationen verlangt, bis man die gewünschte Farbennuance erhalt. Bekanntlich erzählen die alten Schriftsteller, dass man die Entdeckung des Purpurs einen! Schäferhunde verdanke, und es ist ganz glaublich und leicht begreiflich, dass beim Geniessen einer Aplysia sich Schnauze und Haar violett gefärbt habe; aber auf eine Murex kann das nicht passieren: der Hund musste die Schale durchgebissen und das Mollusk hätte ihn auch dann keine farbige Flüssigkeit gegeben.”",

The Janthina is common on the Syrian coast, and Caillardet is found at the rocks near Saida, often covered with aplysia in the spring; they had been played by the waves and exuded a large amount of already violet liquid. Perhaps the use of this has led to the discovery of the true purple. The colored liquid of the aplysia separates itself as soon as you have removed the shell from the Thiere, and still does not require any precautions, while that of the Murex requires all kinds of operations until you get the desired color nuance. As it is well known, the ancient writers say that the discovery of purple is one! Shepherd dogs, and it is quite believable and easy to understand, that when enjoying an Aplysia, the muzzle and hair have dyed violet; but that can’t happen on a Murex: the dog had to bite through the shell and even then, the mollusk wouldn’t have given him a colored liquid.”",

The explanation is probably to be sought in the direction pointed out by the above authors. It may be that this account of the origination of purple-dyeing was simply suggested by the frequent sight of dogs with violet stained mouths in consequence of their having fed upon Aplysia or Janthina cast ashore by storms. On this hypothesis though, the tradition would not warrant the inference that the Aplysia and Janthina preceded the Murex and the Purpura in the purple manufacture. It would, I suppose, carry with it the corollary that species belonging to these genera were employed, at least to some extent, at a certain state, in the development of the industry. For otherwise the story would owe its origin to circles totally uninitiated in the art.

Anyone who is only reasonably familiar with the doctrine of marine dyes en bloc reads clearly between the lines of the relevant digressions of Aristotle and Pliny that Aristotle, where he implicitly speaks of boys who are put into the world by alleged purple snails ‘on which one meets the boys’, alludes to Helix janthina (with which one wants to compare all the relevant reports of the unforgettable Forskal:  ‘Post mortem auctoris edidit Carsten Niebuhr, etc., Hauniae, 1775’), while Pliny speaks of Aplysia (sea hare) where he speaks of the animal algae as an alleged purple snail. Likewise, Pliny meant the dye, the deep purple one, of Aplysia in the passage: ‘Buccinum per se damnatur quoniam ‘focum remittit’. This has never been clearly recognized until now, but it must finally be stabilized.”",
