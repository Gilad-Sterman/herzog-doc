L’auteur grec a eu en vue deux espèces bien distinctes; l’une vivant dans les golfes et donnant une pourpre noire, (je crois qu’il faut interpréter noire par rouge très foncé), l’autre vivant dans la mer et donnant une pourpre rouge, c’est-à-dire plus claire.

The Greek author had in mind two very distinct species; one living in the gulfs and giving a black purple, (I think we should interpret black by very dark red), the other living in the sea and giving a red purple, that is to say lighter. In this he is right, because we know perfectly well today that the dark red purple is given by the <<i#Purpura<< haemastoma L, and the Murex trunculus L, which live in the littoral zone, stuck against the rocks; and that the lighter purple is supplied by Murex brandaris L., which live at greater depth and further from shore.

Die in Papis, Handwörterbuch der Griechischen Sprache II, 649, anzutreffenden Farbenbezeichnungen von Porphyreos als dunkelroth, blauroth, violett sind also ausserordentlich treffend, erschöpfen jedoch bei Weitem nicht die immense Scala der Purpurnüancen.”<<15<< “Ferner bestätigten diese Purpuroben (unbeschadet ihrer decidirt ausgesprochenen zwei Grundfarben Carmin und violett, oder roth und blau, je nachdem Purpur von P.haemastoma oder M.brandaris oder M.trunculus vorlag) durchaus Goethe’s (aus seiner Farbenlehre herrührende) Aussprüche. Der purpur schwebt auf der Grenze zwischen Roth und Blau und neigt sich bald zum Scharlach, bald zum Violetten ‘und das Blaurothe durch die Purpurschneck.’ Dabei verleugneten sich aber wie bemerkt die zwei Hauptkategorien des Purpurs, nämlich: 1. der bluthrothe Purpur oder Oxylblatta und 2. der Janthin oder Hyacinth — oder Amethyst purpur bei keiner einzigen mir vorgelegenen Purpurproben, sofern nämlich: der Process des Farbenwandels bis zum Abschluss gediehen war.”<<16<<",

The color designations of porphyreos found in Papis, Handwörterbuch der Griechischen Sprache II, 649, as dark red, blue-red, violet are therefore extraordinarily appropriate, but by far do not exhaust the immense scala of purple nuances.” ‘Furthermore, those purples (without prejudice to their decidirt pronounced two primary colours carmine and violet, or red and blue, depending on the presence of purple from P.haemastoma or M.brandaris or M.trunculus) certainly confirmed Goethe’s (derived from his theory of colours). The purple floats on the border between red and blue and soon tends to scarlet fever, soon to violet ‘and the blue red by the purple lick.’ However, as noted, the two main categories of purple were denied, namely: 1. bluthroth purple or oxylblatta and 2. janthin or hyacinth — or amethyst purple in not a single purple sample before me, provided that the process of the color change had progressed to the end.“",

Thus prepared, the dye never passes off, and the fabric, whether washed with or without corrosives preserves its colour in its full strength. But if wool of another coloration is used instead, or even the white wool without proper preparation, thou knowest what the result is? Yes, a fugitive colour and an unpleasant one.”",

Perhaps the use of this has led to the discovery of the true purple. The colored liquid of the aplysia separates itself as soon as you have removed the shell from the Thiere, and still does not require any precautions, while that of the Murex requires all kinds of operations until you get the desired color nuance. As it is well known, the ancient writers say that the discovery of purple is one! Shepherd dogs, and it is quite believable and easy to understand, that when enjoying an Aplysia, the muzzle and hair have dyed violet; but that can’t happen on a Murex: the dog had to bite through the shell and even then, the mollusk wouldn’t have given him a colored liquid.”",

It may be that this account of the origination of purple-dyeing was simply suggested by the frequent sight of dogs with violet stained mouths in consequence of their having fed upon Aplysia or Janthina cast ashore by storms. On this hypothesis though, the tradition would not warrant the inference that the Aplysia and Janthina preceded the Murex and the Purpura in the purple manufacture. It would, I suppose, carry with it the corollary that species belonging to these genera were employed, at least to some extent, at a certain state, in the development of the industry. For otherwise the story would owe its origin to circles totally uninitiated in the art.

Anyone who is only reasonably familiar with the doctrine of marine dyes en bloc reads clearly between the lines of the relevant digressions of Aristotle and Pliny that Aristotle, where he implicitly speaks of boys who are put into the world by alleged purple snails ‘on which one meets the boys’, alludes to Helix janthina (with which one wants to compare all the relevant reports of the unforgettable Forskal:  ‘Post mortem auctoris edidit Carsten Niebuhr, etc., Hauniae, 1775’), while Pliny speaks of Aplysia (sea hare) where he speaks of the animal algae as an alleged purple snail.

The tradition crediting Phoenicia with the invention of purple-dyeing is probably true only in the limited sense that it was on the coasts of that country that the art was brought to its technical perfection. Of this we have evidence in the high esteem in which Phoenician purple was universally held. Strabo states that the Tyrian purple was prized above all others. Laconian purple also enjoyed great fame, but not on a level with the Phoenician. It should, however, also be noted that the excellence of the purple of that provenance was partly ascribed to the intrinsic qualities of the purple snails living in the Phoenician waters.<<4<<",

The Indians may have meantime abandoned the use of marine animal dye-stuff for some reasons no longer ascertainable. On the other hand, it is equally possible that the Phoenicians only borrowed the name but not the thing, simply adapting to the colours produced with the purple seasnail terms used in India, in their native forms, of course, for designating the corresponding colours obtained with vegetable dye-stuff; but even on this alternative supposition Phoenician dependence upon India in the dyeing craft will have to be conceded to some extent. The derivation proposed here for <<i#Tekhelet,<< however, is hardly of a nature to furnish a firm base for such far-reaching deductions; that of ארגמן, though plausible enough, is not entirely free from doubt. A Phoenician literature, of course, hardly exists. I have not made a search for <<i#Tekhelet<< or <<i#Argaman<< in Plautus, but it is very unlikely to occur there. In Sanchriathon and in Philo Byllus I have found no mention of purple.

Facilities for purple-dyeing would be offered by both the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. Future research by specialists may, let us hope, succeed in throwing light in this direction. It is, however, I surmise, not very likely that the answer will be discovered in the Egyptian texts themselves either affirmatively or negatively. At best we shall have to be contented with a more or less high degree of probability. Should this, however, point in the negative direction, the general belief in the hoary antiquity of the Phoenician pre-eminence in purple-dyeing will have thereby received at least a mild shaking. From very early times Phoenicia is known to have been under Egyptian influence, and it is only reasonable to suppose that she must have in some way reciprocated. From 1600 to 1350 Egypt exercised dominion over Phoenicia. An inscription on the tomb of Rekhmara, governor of Thebes, under Thothmes III (18th dynasty) represents the former as receiving the homage of Phoenician princes in the name of the Pharaoh.<<1<< Phoenician art from the earliest times exhibits traces of Egyptian influence.

One line reads: “qema nofrzay, “etc. Zay is a word which occurs a number of times in the Egyptian texts. Dr. Dedekind tries to show that it denotes purple, i.e. cloth dyed with (marine) animal secretion. He thus translates the above line: “beautiful cloth of purple,” etc. The learned Egyptologist further points to Papyrus Sallier, No. 2, British Museum, containing a poem in which are discussed the disadvantages of the various crafts and occupations. Of the dyer the poet says:”His hands stink; they have the stench of rotten fish; the dyers sully all garments.” This, Dr. Dedekind holds, distinctly applies to purple dyeing, for, as implied in Pliny and Strabo, and as corroborated by a series of experiments extending from William Cole to Professors Dubois and Friedlaender the purpurgenic matter emits an offensive garlic like smell in the course of its photographic development.<<2<<",

But this and similar facts really do not go to the root of the essential point. Given the correctness of the identification, there is nothing to indicate that the garment in question was dyed in Egypt. Purple garments might well be worn in Egypt without there being a single purple factory in existence in the country. Should it even be absolutely proved that at this or that period purple dyeing was not practised anywhere in the land of the Pharaohs, it would not in the least follow that purple cloth was not then to be found within the Egyptian frontiers. Zaher or Zehir, though a priest of Amon, might wear without prejudice to his sacred office a garment made and dyed abroad. It is possible that during their ministration in the temple, Egyptian priests would take care to exclude from their attire articles of dress of foreign make, though 1 cannot recall anything giving the palest colour to an assumption of this kind. But then there is no indication that the garment in question formed part of the priest’s sacerdotal wardrobe. Very probably it did not; in early Egypt fine white linen to the exclusion of colour of any sort was the rule for the priestly dress during officiation in the sanctuary.<<3<<",

One can only express the hope that the identifications will one day be verified by Professor Friedlaender’s chemical examinations. A distinction must be drawn between textiles and artistic paintings. The evidence of the former only goes to show that purple fabrics might here and there be met with in Pharaonic Egypt. The latter, on the other hand, if they proclaim themselves as of native origin prove at least that painting, if not dyeing, with purple was practised, provided, of course, that their paint is shown by Professor Friedlaender’s method to be of molluscan origin. This would be already a great gain. The derivation proposed by the eminent Austrian Egyptologist for zay connecting it with purple would, if correct, prove that at a certain time purple formed a very highly prized article of luxury in Egypt, though one would be at a loss to tell for what particular use it was then employed, whether for clothing or for tapestry, or for both. Of incomparably greater significance is the Papyrus Sallier No. 2 (British Museum). Does it necessarily follow that the text refers to purple dyeing? Indigo, which, as we know, was anciently employed in Egypt, likewise emits an ammonia-like smell at a certain stage in its manufacture. But perhaps this is less than what the language of the text warrants. Again, may not the stench have been due to the employment of urine, which, as we know from Pliny, entered into the manufacture of even certain purple varieties? But this also perhaps fails to satisfy the poet’s sweeping condemnation of the dyeing craft.<<21<< Lastly, may not the old Egyptian poet have in mind certain acids used in dyeing? We know that at least about Pliny’s time, acids were so employed in Egypt. But all such doubts and murmurings must be hushed into silence on hearing the great dyer and chemist, Professor P.

This, as Professor Stephen Langdon, Shillito Professor of Assyriology at Oxford University, has kindly informed me, is the earliest known mention of takiltu. In Assyrian, according to Professor Langdon, takiltu does not occur before the 8th century B.C. “The word appears in Mitanni,” so Professor Langdon states in a private communication to me, “about the same time as in Babylonia, hence we might infer that they borrowed it either from the Mitanni or the Aramaic peoples. It may, like <<i#Argamannu<<, eventually be a loan-word from India.<<1<< Takiltu appears to have been brought to Babylonia by the Cassites. It occurs in the business documents of the Cassite Kings, and became current in Babylonia after the 16th century, <<i#Argamannu<<, or bright purple, occurs first in Assyria about the eighth century.

There are, however, two or more instances where they are preceded by another word than sipatu (wool): “Kito… subatu takiltu subatu <<i#Argamannu<< -… cloth of takiltu, cloth of <<i#Argamannu<<“;<<2<< “a-na mu-ti i ta-kil-tav-ar-ga-man-nu.”<<3<< Does then the occurrence of sipatu with takiltu or <<i#Argamannu<< imply that these fabrics were also made of other stuff than wool, for otherwise there would have been no need to indicate the nature of the material? Not at all! The force of sipatu in these connections is simply to describe the stuff as raw wool in contradiction to cloth or textile (subatu or some such word). Quite to the contrary, the fact that subatu carries with it no indication of the stuff warrants the inference that it was in all cases the same, that is, wool. But how are we to explain kitu, which means linen? The difficulty has already been discussed under other aspects in connection with Egypt. It will interest the reader to learn the view of Professor Langdon. Replying to the objection I had raised from kitu takiltu as against his assertion that “neither word occurs apart from wool,” the learned professor, writing under date of February 8th, 1914, says: “On a faussement transcrit ce passage. Il n’y a pas kitu takiltu nulle part.” There is thus, according to Professor Langdon, an end to the matter once and for all. I may add, however, that Professor Sayce, in his reply to me with regard to kitu takiltu, says nothing against the correctness of the transcription, but simply explains the grounds for the rendering of kitu by linen, suggesting, however, that perhaps it may mean cotton, for, as King has shown, cotton was anciently used in Babylonia.",

The <<i#Tekhelet<< and <<i#Argaman<< furnished by the Isles of Elishah are obviously described as imported for home use,<<10<< for the embellishment of life in Tyre; whereas verses 23-24 speak of the supplying of wares to the Tyrian merchant princes for their cosmopolitan commerce. However excellent its purple might be, Tyria could not possibly supply the whole world, and there would be a number of extra-Phoenician purple factories sending their wares to Tyre, the mistress of the seas, for shipment and transport by her merchants and sailors to various trading centres. Great Britain supplies many a parallel. The same remarks apply to Aran, which is also mentioned,<<11<< as having been in the habit of supplying <<i#Argaman<< among other kinds of merchandise.",

The utmost that Higher Criticism might grant would probably be that at least contemporaneously with P purple had the same currency and high value in Egypt as in Babylonia or in Palestine, but even such a concession, meagre as it is, would be little short of an act of grace depending on the subjectivity of the critic. The general tendency in critical circles would perhaps be toanswer first in the negative the question with regard to purple in Pharaonic Egypt and then to take the regular occurrence of <<i#Tekhelet<< and <<i#Argaman<< in Exodus XXV as one more illustration of P’s projectional practices.",

May not this ardent devotion to the Sun have brought about the introduction of purple which owes its colour to the action of the sunrays, and which, as we know, was anciently regarded as the special favourite of the great source of light?<<6<< “The purple dye delights in close contact with the Sun. His rays blazen it up, making its splendour greater and more brilliant,” etc. The ancients with their small knowledge of nature could not help attributing the photographic property of the purple liquid to the direct favour of the Sun. It is worth comparing, in this connection, the Phoenician belief associating purple with Astarte, the consort of Baal the Sun-god. The Phoenician priests of Baal were clothed in sumptuous purple garments. It was perhaps under Asiatico-Semitic influence that Amenhophis acted in setting up the Sun-god as the deity of his nation. If I remember aright, his mother was an Asiatic princess of Semitic origin. Asiatic influence would certainly promote the introduction of purple. But perhaps Amenhophis IV’s religious resolution was simply a determined return to the original Egyptian cult. The sun is the most ancient object of worship to be met with on the Egyptian monuments. Ra was venerated from the earliest times in the land of the Pyramids. In that case colour in general would come back to favour, if, as Ermann states, in the very early ages dyed garments were worn to a great extent.

Genesis XXXVII, 3c “and he made him a coat of many colours.” Judges V, 30, implies that coloured and embroidered garments were much in vogue among the Israelites of Deborah’s age. The Kings of the Midianites, near kinsmen of the Hebrews, wore mantles of Argaman as royal insignia: Judges VIII, 26c, Saul’s reaction against Kanaanitism left the fancy for colour altogether untouched at least, as far as concerned female dress “O daughters of Israel, weep for Saul, who clothed you in scarlet with beautiful dresses, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel” (II Samuel, I, 24).<<n<<Cf.

                    "The famous inscription of Merenptah found by Professor Flinders Petrie in 1896 in the King’s funeral temple at Thebes, containing, as the late Professor Driver says (Modern Research, etc., p. 38), the earliest mention of Israel known at present to occur on any monument, raises, as that distinguished Biblical scholar rightly remarks, “more questions than it solves.” I may be permitted to observe that a Jewish tradition which, though recorded in the Aggadah, may represent a reminiscence from the earliest days, tells of an abortive partial exodus thirty years before the great universal Exodus. See: Sanhedrin 92b: Who were the dead that Ezekiel called back into life? Rab said they were the Ephraimites who had wrongly calculated the era of the redemption,” etc. Cf., Rashi ad locum. Pirke d’Rabbi Eliezer: “R. Eliezer said all through the sojourn of the Israelites in Egypt the Ephraimites lived in the greatest security and prosperity, until there arose Nun, a descendant of Ephraim, and said, God has revealed Himself unto me, bidding me take you out from Egypt. His tribesmen, buoyed up by their royal descent (seilicet, from Joseph, the viceroy of Egypt) and their great warlike abilities then rose up, and, taking their sons and daughters with them went out from Egypt. Hereupon the Egyptians arose and killed all their mighty men of valour.” Mekhilta, Exodus XIII, i: Aliter “… this refers to the Ephraimite war … because they observed not God’s covenant and refused to walk in His law and they trespassed the appointed end and the oath: (it was therefore to be feared) that the Israelites, seeing the bones of their brothers strewn in Philistia, might return back to Egypt.”<<n<<The inscription in Professor Lehmann-Haupt’s translation reads as follows: “… The princes are prosträte, saying ‘Salam’. Not one among the Barbarians raises his head. Laid waste is Lybia … Canaan is seized with every evil. Ashkelon is led captive. Gezer is taken. Jenoam is annihilated. The Israelite tribe its men are few, its seed exists no more. Palestine (Charu, land of the Charités) has become a widow for Egypt (i.e. helpless before her). All lands are united and at peace. Everyone who was a marauder is held in check by King Merenptah,” etc.<<n<<It has been argued from certain indications in the inscription that the abode of the tribe of Israel to which the text refers is to be sought in the Mountains of Ephraim. (See Lehmann-Haupt, Die Geschichte Judas und Israels im Rahmen der Weltgeschichte. I, Tiibingen (1911), p. 2930-). This affords a curious point of contact with the Aggadah insofar as the latter connects members of the Ephraimite stock with a pre-Exodian partial excursion from the land of oppression. Professor Lehmann-Haupt, it may be added, in an original discussion, tries to show that the Israelites are spoken of in the inscription as a people not yet fixedly settled in Palestine, (ib., p. 30 in fine). May not the pride of Ephraim have had something to do with reminiscences of that bold venture, with the fact that their ancestors had preceded all the other tribes in Palestine?<<n<<Exodus 44 .5-: “And the King of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, hinder the people from their work? Get you unto your own affairs.” 5: “And Pharaoh said, Behold the people of the land now are many, and ye disturb them in the pursuit of their labours.” Verse 5 implies, I feel, a rejoiner to Pharaoh’s question in verse 4, suppressed in the text.<<n<<A distinction is also apparently made between “now” and a past occasion. May not an allusion be contained here to a previous time when a Pharaoh had granted a favour similar to that prayed for by Moses an Aaron in verse 3. I do not wish to suggest that this has any relation with the problem raised by the inscription of Merenptah. With reference to the same subject, it may be remarked that the escape of a portion of the Hebrew race from Goshen might be favoured by the invasion of the Delta by the Lybians, which took place in the fifth year of Merenptah’s reign.",

The impression thus created is that <<i#Tekhelet<< does not fall under the appellation Prophyra. I do not wish to imply that <<i#Porphyra<< was not elastic enough to be used sometimes as a term embracing all kinds of purple, including <<i#Iakinthos<<, but that in its ordinary sense it denoted fabrics distinctly differing in colour from <<i#Iakinthos,<< so that its conjunction with the latter term involved no clashing or overlapping.",

If it were shown that the <<i#Tekhelet<< dye in the earliest time was of vegetable origin, it would follow that a later age made the change to a marine animal dyestuff, for, as will soon be made clear, we have indisputable evidence that at least in the last decades of the Second Temple <<i#Tekhelet<< was certainly of the latter origin.

A description is also given of the <<i#Tekhelet hillazon<<: tests are prescribed for detecting fraudulent imitations with a certain vegetable dyestuff (kala-ilan). Though the Talmudic passages in question deal mainly with <<i#Tekhelet<< used for the ritual fringes on the garments<<4<< or <<i#tzitzit<<, there is not, I think, the flimsiest ground for drawing a distinction between this and the sacerdotal and cultural <<i#Tekhelet<< (תכלת של מקדש תכלת של בגדי כהונה). I cannot think of any plausible reason for a distinction of this kind. In the Sifre<<5<< a gezerah shavah (גזירה שוה) is in fact instituted with reference to quite another point between <<i#Tekhelet<< in Numbers XV, 37, and <<i#Tekhelet<< in Exodus XXV, 4 in connection with the Tabernacle. The reader who has the elementary knowledge of the Talmud knows that, according to most authorities, in a case like this the two members of the gezerah shavah have absolutely the same signification (אין גזירה שוה למחצה). In the course of a discussion in the Talmud (ib.) relating to <<i#Tekhelet<< S (Tekhelet S throughout this chapter will stand for Tekhelet of the tzitzit; Tekhelet T for Tekhelet of the Temple (sacerdotal and cultural Tekhelet) ). a baraitha is adduced referring expressly to <<i#Tekhelet<< T, thus showing the identity of the two.

Though standing in a tractate dealing especially with <<i#tzitzit<< it is practically meant to have universal application. But perhaps it might be objected that the baraitha dating presumably from a time posterior to the destruction of the Temple has in view only <<i#Tekhelet<< S. The Tosephta Menahot Ch. X, however, contains a baraitha expressly referring to <<i#Tekhelet<< T: “<<i#Tekhelet<< is not ritually fit, unless it is from the dyestuff of the <<i#hillazon<<; if it is not from the <<i#hillazon<< it is not fit.” (תכלת אין כשירה אלא מן החלזון שלא מן החלזון פסולה) .

Even the Tosephta Menahot, so explicit on <<i#Tekhelet<< under this aspect, says not a word about <<i#Argaman<<. This is the more remarkable seeing that next to the above halakah relating to <<i#Tekhelet<< there appears in the Tosephta an halakah laying down a certain restriction with regard to the provenance of tola’ath shani or scarlet, the regular pendant of <<i#Tekhelet<< and <<i#Argaman<< in the Pentateuch. Disagreement between the LXX, Philo and Josephus on the one hand and the Tosephta on the other is not to be thought of. My explanation is simply this: There was no necessity for formulating a law in rejection of nonconchylian dyestuffs for <<i#Argaman<<, simply because the word <<i#Argaman<< itself denoted nothing but purple dye or purple stuff, being the equivalent of the Greek or the Latin <<i#Purpura: Argaman<< also designated the species of sea-snail productive of the dye which, when applied to clothing stuff gave to the latter the name of <<i#Argaman<<. To have said that stuff dyed with vegetable pigment is not <<i#Argaman<<, however close its colour to the latter might be, would have been like saying, for instance, that counterfeit gold might not do when Law required gold (zahab).",

Tekhelet always precedes <<i#Argaman<< just as zahab (harsu) (gold) ever precedes keseph (kaspu) (silver). “Gold and silver … and <<i#Tekhelet<< and <<i#Argaman<<,” etc., in the Pentateuch; “gold, silver … <<i#takiltu, Argamannu<<,”etc., in the cuneiform texts. This phenomenon makes it evident that <<i#Tekhelet<< was the more precious stuff. Now we know that in antiquity purple was infinitely more expensive than fabrics dyed with vegetable pigment.

Thus <<i#Argaman<< according to him is not purple at all but a vegetable dyestuff. He refers, of course, at the very beginning of his essay to the Greek versions, but <<i#Iakinthos<< he misunderstands and Porphyra for <<i#Argaman<< he simply rejects.<<2<< For the present suffice it to remark that Riedel has reckoned without the host. It is all very well arguing the incorrectness of this or that rendering in the old versions, but in a case like the present one, any amount of argument and dialectic is so much empty talk. The authors of the LXX, Philo and Josephus, all lived in times when both <<i#Tekhelet<< and <<i#Argaman<< were used in the temple. Josephus indeed officiated himself in the Sanctuary. Their renderings are not merely renderings; they are unimpeachable testimonies that <<i#Tekhelet<< and <<i#Argaman<< in the days of the Second Temple were known as, and designated by, <<i#Iakinthos<< and <<i#Porphyra<< respectively.

This might be taken as an indication that when nothing is said to the contrary, <<i#hillazon<< in the Talmud should be understood as applying to the purple-giving molluscs. On a closer examination, however, it becomes clear that no such inference is warranted by the passage in question. The tacit assumption underlying the Gemara is simply based upon the self evident consideration that a Jew would have no business to fish any but purple-giving molluscs; for the mollusca belong to the division of impure animals which may not be eaten by Jews: The law also forbids the direct engaging in the commerce of impure edibles.<<1<< To meet the possible objection that a Jew fishing on Sabbath might as well eat forbidden food, I should add that the baraitha deals with transgression due to ignorance (שוגג). Fishing of mollusca for medical purposes would be too rare to necessitate and express negation on the part of the Gemara. Apart from this consideration it is probably that Jews would not themselves fish the species they needed for pharamaceutic uses but would procure them from gentile dealers.",

Or, again, it might be possible for the pure-blue theory to admit Murex trunculus in general as the <<i#Tekhelet<< species but with the necessary limitation that the dye received certain treatment.

Was it an attempt made in certain quarters to replace the traditional <<i#hillazon-shel-Tekhelet<< by some other species? Or does the baraitha owe its origin to a desire on the part of the Jewish authorities to enlighten the general public with regard to the true nature of the <<i#Tekhelet<< dye in view of a widely prevalent error that kala-ilan (vegetable dyestuff producing a <<i#Tekhelet<<-like colour) might do for <<i#Tekhelet shel tzitzit?<< Or again, does the description simply represent an halakhah pure and simple taught in the academies as explanatory of the halakhah dating from hoary antiquity:תכלת אלא בחלזון אין צובעין <<i#“Tekhelet<< is not kasher (ritually fit), except if dyed with the blood of the <<i#hillazon”<< There is, I think, some ground for supposing that the baraitha represents an epistle sent to the diaspora (גולה) either for the purpose of enlightening extraPalestinian Jewry, or in direct answer to the inquiry about the identity of the <<i#hillazon-shel-Tekhelet<<. The final statement לפיכך דמיו יקרים “Therefore (i.e., because of the rarity of the species) it (<<i#Tekhelet<<) is very dear” would have been a superfluity in an halakhah taught at a Palestinian academy. The hearers of the lecture would be as cognisant of the cause of the expensiveness of <<i#Tekhelet<< as the lecturer himself. In an ordinary discourse the point might well be mentioned but in a formal concise halakhah it would be rather out of place. If, on the other hand, the baraitha was primarily intended for the information of the exiled communities, the case would be different. People buying at an exorbitant price <<i#Tekhelet<< shel <<i#tzitzit<< sent from the Holy Land might be eager to learn the reason of the high expensiveness of the article.",

Ces animaux sont <<i#pélagiques<< c’est-à-dire qu’ils habitent presque continuellement la haute mer à la surface et que, dans <<i#tous les cas<<, ils ne vivent jamais fixés au rivage comme les Pourpres, les Murex, etc… Ils se tiennent à la surface des eaux, malgre leur coquille légère mais cependant d’un poids appréciable grace à un flotteur où ils collent leurs oeufs. Leur coloration est d’un beau bleu violacé, qui se confond assez facilement avec la couleur de la mer. <<n<< Enfin et vous verrez de suite l’importance de cette dernière remarque comme un grand nombre d’animaux pélagiques, les Janthines sont certaines années extraordinairement abondantes, alors que les années précédentes elles étaient rares ou même très rares. Quand elles sont très abondantes, les coups de mers, même peu violents, les rejettent en grande quantité sur le rivage où elles sont très facilement recueillies, même encore vivantes. C’est sans doute à cette particularité qui n’avait pas dû échapper aux habitants qu’il faut attribuer la périodicité septuagénaire de l’apparence du <<i#hillazon<< dont parle le Talmud. Mais cette périodicité n’est pas en réalite régulière: la vérité est que, en partant d’une année où les Janthines sont très abondantes, on voit pendant plusieurs années (3,4 ou 5 ans, parfois même davantage) ces animaux devenir beaucoup plus rares, pour être à nouveau extraordinairement communs pendant une nouvelle saison et ainsi de suite. <<n<< J’oubliais de vous dire que les 2 Janthines citées précédemment vivant sur les côtes de Syrie, notamment <<i#J. prolongata<< Blainville qui fournit le plus abondamment la teinture.

The type is Lamarck’s Janthina communis… which is linne’s Helix janthina. But this species does not live in the Mediterranean. The Janthines that inhabit this sea belong mainly to the following two species: Janthina pallida de Harvey207 and Janthina prolongata de Blainville.208 <<n<< As you have seen from the texts quoted by you (p. 6 of your manuscript), these animals abundantly provide a bright and brilliant purplish blue coloring liquor. <<n<< The peculiarities attributed to the hillazon by the Talmudic tradition are, I believe, at least largely due to the modus vivendi of the Janthines. These animals are pelagic that is to say that they inhabit almost continuously the high seas on the surface and that, in any case, they never live fixed to the shore like the Purples, the Murex, etc … They stand on the surface of the waters, despite their light shell but nevertheless of an appreciable weight thanks to a float where they stick their eggs. Their coloration is a beautiful purplish blue, which can be easily confused with the color of the sea. <<n<< Finally, you will immediately see the importance of this last remark as a large number of pelagic animals, Janthines for some years are extraordinarily abundant, while in previous years they were rare or even very rare. When they are very abundant, the blows of the sea, even if not very violent, throw them back in large quantities on the shore where they are very easily collected, if still alive. It is undoubtedly to this peculiarity, which must not have escaped the inhabitants, that we must attribute the septuagenarian periodicity of the appearance of the hillazon of which the Talmud speaks. But this periodicity is not in regular reality: the truth is that, starting from a year when the Janthines are very abundant, we see for several years (3, 4 or 5 years, sometimes even more) these animals become much rarer, to be again extraordinarily common during a new season and so on. <<n<< I forgot to tell you that the 2 Janthines mentioned above living on the coast of Syria, including J. prolongata Blainville which provides the most abundant dye, The objections drawn from the authors cited by you (pp. 6 and 7 of your work) against this identification of the hillazon do not stand up to scrutiny since they are based on the Linnaeus Helix janthina, which is Lamarck’s Janthina communis, a species that does not live in the Mediterranean.”",

The subject will be treated later, but I may say here that Dr. Germain’s conception of the <<i#Tekhelet<<-nuance is in harmony with the trend of Jewish tradition. The pure-bluish will be very nearly satisfied. As Dr. Germain describes the dye as “teinture bleue (blue dye)” at the outset of his instructive reply, his later definition of the colour as “bleu violacé (purplish blue)” need not trouble much the pure-blue theory.

This Hellenic designation of the fabric most certainly was not confined to <<i#Tekhelet<< of Jewish provenance. Or was the difference between the Jewish and the Phoenician practice due to a change on the part of the latter? <<i#Tekhelet<< dyeing on the earliest times had been confined to the <<i#Janthina<< pigment; while the Phoenicians at a certain point of time abandoned the <<i#Janthina<< in favour of the <<i#Murex trunculus<<, the Jews continued to adhere exclusively to the former. For ritual <<i#Tekhelet<< the Law required cloth dyed with the <<i#Janthina<< pigment because the dyeing with it was believed to go back to Mosaic times, while the <<i#Tekhelet<< from <<i#Murex trunculus<< was looked upon as post-Mosaic. The hypothesis is, I think, hardly tenable. In the Talmud mention is made only of <<i#kala-ilan<<, a certain colour produced from a vegetable stuff, as an inadmissible substitute for ritual <<i#Tekhelet<<. Again, the tests prescribed for ascertaining the genuine character of a given sample of <<i#Tekhelet<< would have little meaning on that hypothesis. How could it be ascertained by means of the tests that the <<i#Tekhelet<<, though not <<i#kala-ilan<<, was dyed with the pigment of the <<i#hillazon-shel-Tekhelet<<, and not with that of <<i#Murex trunculus<<? Here, however, there is a loophole of escape for the hypothesis in question, should the dye of the Janthina prove to be faster than that of <<i#Murex trunculus<<; for then the tests might well distinguish <<i#Tekhelet<< dyed with Janthina from that dyed with <<i#M. trunculus<<. It may also be worth remarking that as the pigment of <<i#Murex trunculus<< is <<i#not<< fast to washing while the <<i#Tekhelet<<-dye, according to the Talmud, appears to possess greater fastness than indigo which is fast to washing, it follows that the <<i#Tekhelet<< secretion is faster than that of <<i#Murex trunculus<<. As, however, we do not know the exact nature of the drugs with which the <<i#hillazon<< secretion was mixed in the manufacture of <<i#Tekhelet<<, we cannot confidently assert that the <<i#Tekhelet<< pigment, whatever it may be, is faster than that of <<i#Murex trunculus<<.",

One  is  the  colour  of  the  heliotrope,  some- times  of  a  light,  though  usually  of  a  deeper,  tint ; another  is  that  of  the  mallow,  shading  into  a  purple ; vet  a  third,  seen  in  the  late  violet,  is  the  most  vivid  of the  murex  tints.”",

Nature has thus preserved for us an illustration of the colour of the <<i#Purpura<< ianthina. W. Adolf Schmidt<<3<< comes to the conclusion that amethystina, ianthina, and hyacinthina are synonyms denoting one and the same purple-variety. The identification of ianthina with amethystina is based upon Pliny 21, 8, just quoted (“et ipse in purpurum quemque ianthinum appelarimus”). The equation of hyacinth with the two is founded upon the following reasoning: Pliny and Vergil emphasize the blackness or darkness of shade of the violet purple (<<i#Purpura<< violacea). Philo qualifies the hyacinth purple as black or dark: <<i#Purpura<< hyacinthina is the same as P. amesthystina or ianthina. Another argument is derived from the fact that the <<i#Purpura<< violacea is classed as <<i#Purpura<< blatta or pure purple unmixed with other materials. Now the Lex Valentina<<4<< divides <<i#Purpura<< blatta into two classes (a) oxyblatta; and (b) hyacinthina. Oxyblatta, as is shown by Schmidt being identical with the <<i#Purpura<< Tyria, hyacinthina must be identical with the <<i#Purpura<< violacea, ergo, etc. … Dr. Dedekind accepts these equations. <<i#Tekhelet<< would thus be violet purple of the colour of the Viola odorata L. Dr. Dedekind, however, in subscribing on the one hand to the equations established by Schmidt and in maintaining on the other that the species furnishing <<i#Tekhelet<< must be identified with Murex trunculus is somewhat inconsistent. The amethyst or ianthina colour as described by Pliny, was the result of a mixture in certain proportions of the dyestuffs obtained from two different species, the one furnishing black and the other red pigment. It is precisely this fact which at once cuts away the ground from under the attempted identification of <<i#Tekhelet<< as handed down by Talmudic tradition with Pliny’s <<i#Purpura<< amesthystina or ianthina. <<i#Tekhelet<< according to the Talmud was dyed with the pigment of one particular species of which a description is given Menahot 44a. Schmidt being unacquainted with the Talmud was not aware of this fatal objection. On quite different grounds, however, Schmidt reaches a certain conclusion which if applied here might save his position. Having learnt from Bochart that according to Maimonides the colour of <<i#Tekhelet<< was sky-blue, (not violet or amethyst-like) he draws a distinction between the Tekhelet of the LXX, and Philo and that of Maimonides.",

He accordingly identifies Maimonides’ <<i#Tekhelet<< with the heliotrope variety of conchylium. Now, as the <<i#Purpura<< conchyliata, according to Pliny, was dyed with only black purple pigment Schmidt might have met the argument from the Talmudic description of the <<i#Tekhelet hillazon<< by the assumption that already in early Talmudic times <<i#Tekhelet<< was a kind of <<i#Purpura<< conchyliata. It is, however, rather unlikely that such an important change in the manufacture of ritual <<i#Tekhelet<< took place in Tanaitic times.

Certain grades of violet are only with very great difficulty distinguishable from blue. That the colour of <<i#Tekhelet<< or hyacinth is likened to that of the sea or of the sky only proves that <<i#Tekhelet<< was not easily distinguishable from deep blue: a deep dark violet-blue would be classed by the ancients, as indeed by most people to-day, as a deep-blue. We have seen that the sea is sometimes described as resembling the colour of the ianthina ( Viola odorata L.), and that Hieronymus likens the ianthina-colour to that of the sky.<<1<<",

It is worth while remarking that it ought not to be supposed for a moment that the data furnished byPliny with reference to purple have universal application embracing all localities and all ages. Pliny in all probability drew his information on the subject from Italian sources. His statements therefore refer in the first place to purple as manufactured in the Italian dye-houses at, or about, his time. In Phoenicia and in Palestine, things may have been somewhat different. Italian taste and fashion may have held in small favour the hyacinth purple properly so called, preferring the violet shades to those inclining more to blue. The <<i#Purpura<< conchyliata on the other hand, though less expensive than the <<i#Purpura<< Tyria and the amethystina, had a charm of its own. Pliny admires the delicacy of shade of the vestes conchyliatae. It is quite possible that <<i#Tekhelet<< is not comprised even in the <<i#Purpura<< conchyliata. Schmidt, as already has been said, identifies the later <<i#Tekhelet<<, that of which Maimonides speaks, with the heliotrope variety of Pliny’s Purpura conchyliata. The identification is really due to Bochart though the latter makes no distinction between earlier and later <<i#Tekhelet<<. I do not think the theory has a great measure of probability. The characteristic mark of the vestes conchyliatae was their lightness or paleness of shade in contradistinction to the dark or deep tones of the <<i#Purpura<< blatta. But the <<i#Tekhelet<< is called black by Philo, and Schmidt’s distinction between earlier and later <<i#Tekhelet<< not seeming to me probable, I do not feel at all inclined to accept the identification of <<i#Tekhelet<< with Pliny’s heliotrope conchyliata purple.",

Josephus, as already has been remarked, assumes his readers to be fully cognisant of the fact. Josephus, we have seen, makes two assertions about the hyacinth (<<i#Tekhelet<<) colour (a) that it is black (dark) of hilo and (b) that it reproduces the colour of the sky.

The natural colour of pure sea water is blue and this is emphasized in deep and very clear water which appears almost black to the eye… The greatest transparency hitherto reported is in the eastern basin of the Mediterranean where J. Huksch found the disk visible as a rule from 2 to 7 fathoms, and off the Syrian coast even to 33 fathoms.”<<2<< Combining now the two statements: (1) that the greater the transparency the deeper is the blue, and that (2) off the Syrian coast the greatest transparency has been reported; we at once obtain the result that <<i#Tekhelet<< was very much like the deep blue of the Mediterranean along the Palestinian coast.

But Aben Ezra really refers to Talmudic or Midrashic authority and not to his personal experience. Dr. Dedekind in a private communication to me with reference to my treatment of asabim draws attention to his explanation of Aben Ezra’s <<i#yarok<<. <<i#Tekhelet domeh l’asabim<< “”<<i#Tekhelet<< is like grass” can, however, hardly be so interpreted: the green stage of development is as much a characteristic of <<i#Argaman<< as of <<i#Tekhelet<<. Again it was certainly to the final tone not to any of the transitory stages that the name <<i#Tekhelet<< was given. A theory devised for explaining the significance of <<i#Tekhelet<< would have had little meaning if it were only applicable to a passing stage of the dyeing and one, moreover, which is common to all purple varieties.

The translation current in the Jewish schools which at least in an instance like this undoubtedly is derived from good old tradition knows only of one rendering of <<i#Tekhelet<<, viz., blue. There can be no doubt that this was also the usual rendering in Rashi’s days. The school translation was not exactly based upon R. Meir’s saying but went back to oral tradition dating from the time the Jews first settled in Germany, France, etc. Rashi’s view of <<i#Tekhelet<< shows that he preferred consulting written sources, to relying upon oral tradition. According to him, as already explained, the position of Yam (sea) in R. Meir’s famous homily indicates that the nearest likeness of the <<i#Tekhelet<< colour is presented by the sea. Rashi would therefore turn to the sea for an illustration of what <<i#Tekhelet<< must have looked like.",

Ada had not yet been discovered. This method, however, all too freely employed by modern criticism of the Bible, is but rarely resorted to in the Talmud. The Talmud reconciles the discrepancy by explaining the Baraitha as meaning that tests are useless because no test can ascertain whether the stuff is not trial-<<i#Tekhelet<<, or dyed as an essay to see whether the dye had already reached the desired degree of perfection: טעימה. In that case it would of course be unfit on the ground of shelo lishmah, that it is not expressly dyed for the ritual purpose. Tekhelet must therefore be obtained from an authoritative source. But if so, one might reasonably inquire, what is the good of the tests of R. Isaac and R. Ada?
